**Skyrim Outfit System Revived** is my attempt to resurrect an excellent Skyrim SE mod created by DavidJCobb and aers. The release package is available on the [Skyrim SE Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42162). The complete source code is on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/metricexpansion/SkyrimOutfitSystemSE). Here's a little video that shows how this mod works.
