While there was a port for Skyrim SE, it only ever worked on version 1.5.73 of the game and was never updated for any newer version. Worse, it was taken down. My revival of the mod has been successful, and you can see more details on the project page!</description></item><item><title>Skyrim Outfit System Revived</title><link>http://avinashvakil.com/projects/skyrim-outfit-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://avinashvakil.com/projects/skyrim-outfit-system/</guid><description>Skyrim Outfit System Revived is my attempt to resurrect an excellent Skyrim SE mod created by DavidJCobb and aers. The release package is available on the Skyrim SE Nexus. The complete source code is on GitLab.
The basic concept is to allow the player to decouple the appearance of their armor from its stats. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little video that shows how this mod works.
DavidJCobb made the original version for Skyrim LE.</description></item></channel></rss>
