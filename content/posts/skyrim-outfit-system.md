I recently started working on reviving the Skyrim Outfit System mod for Skyrim SE. While there was a port for Skyrim SE, it only ever worked on version 1.5.73 of the game and was never updated for any newer version. Worse, it was taken down. My revival of the mod has been successful, and you can see more details on the [project page]({{<ref "/projects/skyrim-outfit-system.md">}})!
